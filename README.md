🎮 Rock Paper Scissors Game — Python 🐍
This is a simple implementation of the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game in Python. The player competes against the computer, which randomly chooses one of the three options.

✅ Concepts Used:

Conditional Statements (if, elif, else)

Loops (while)

Dictionaries (to define winning logic)

Random module (random.choice())

🧠 What's special? Instead of writing multiple if-else statements for every possible outcome, the winning rules are defined using a Python dictionary for a cleaner, smarter solution.
